            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Right Truſty and Well-beloved Madam <hi>Creſſwell</hi> and <hi>Damaris Page,</hi> with the reſt of the ſuffering Siſter-hood in <hi>Dog and Bitch Yard, Lukeners Lane, Saffron Hill, Moor-fields, Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliff-Highway,</hi> &amp;c. We greet you well, in giving you to underſtand our Noble Mind, by returning our Thanks, which you are worthy of, in rendring us our Titles of Honour, which are but our Due. For on <hi>Shrove-Tueſday</hi> laſt, Splendidly did we appear upon the Theatre at W. H. being to amazement wonderfully deck'd with Jewels and Diamonds, which the (abhorred and to-be-undone) Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this Kingdom have payed for. We have been alſo Serene and Illuſtrious ever ſince the Day that <hi>Mars</hi> was ſo inſtrumental to reſtore our Goddeſs <hi>Venus</hi> to her Temple and Worſhip; where, by ſpecial Grant, we quickly became a Famous Lady: And as a Reward of our Devotion, ſoon created Right Honorouble, the Counteſs of <hi>Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.</hi> And as a further addition to our Illuſtrious Serenity, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ancient Rules and laudable Cuſtoms of our Order, we have <hi>cum privilegio</hi> alwayes (without our Husband) ſatistied our ſelf with the Delights of <hi>Venus</hi>; and in our Husbands abſence have had a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Off-ſpring, (who are Bountifully and Nobly provided for.) Which Practice hath Epiſcopal Allowance alſo, according to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nciples of Seer <hi>Shelden,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If Women have not Children by their own Husbands, they are bound (to prevent their Damnation) to try by uſing the means with other men</hi>: Which wholeſome and pleaſing Doctrine did for ſometime hold me faſt to his Religion But ſince this Seer hath ſhewn more Cowardize, than Principles or Policy, in fearing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the True, Ancient, Uniform, Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sſal, and moſt Holy Mother Church; Therefore we tell you (with all the Siſterhood) That we are now no longer of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which is but like a Brazen-Baſon tied to a Barbers wooden Pole, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Proteſtant Doctrine and Order tied by Parliamentary Power to Roman Catholick Foundations, Conſtitutions, and Rights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And are become a Convert to, and a profeſſed Member of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; where the worthy Fathers and Confeſſors, as <hi>Durandus, Gentianus,</hi> with multitudes of others, (who were not, neither are, of the Proteſtant, Puritanical, and Fanatical Conventicling Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) do declare, <hi>That Venerial Pleaſures, accompanied with Looſneſs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">

            <p>But when we underſtood, in your Addreſs, the Barbarity of thoſe Rude Apprentices, and the cruel Sufferings that the Siſterhood was expoſed unto; eſpecially thoſe which were in a hopeful way of Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and others that were diſabled from giving Accommodation to their Right Honourable Devotaries, with the danger which you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced us our own Perſon was in, together with the remembrance of our two New Corivals, with <hi>Little Miſs</hi>: We were for many hours ſwallowed up with ſorrow, and almoſt drownd in Tears, and could not at all be comforted, until the ſweet ſound of the Report came to our Ears, <hi>That the L. C. J. K. and his Brethren, with our Counſel learned in the Law, had Commiſſion and Inſtruction given to frame a Bill of Indictment againſt thoſe Trayterous and Rebellious Boys, And to ſelect a Jury of Gentlemen that ſhould ſhow them no favour</hi>: At which our Noble Spirit revived, and preſently we conſulted how we might expreſs our Grace and Compaſsion towards you, and alſo ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably provide for the future ſafety of your Practice; and exerciſe our Revenge upon thoſe that ſo groſly abuſed you, and therein offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch an inſufferable Affront to our Eminency, that we cannot bear without great Indignation.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> For your Safety, we do conjure all <hi>French, Iriſsh,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh Hectors,</hi> to be a Guard to the whole Siſterhood, and to take up their Quarters with them for their better ſecurity; and if they want Money for their ſubſiſtance, let them put on Courage, and take it up on the High-ways; and if any of them ſhould be taken in the Fact, we ſhall, upon our Honour, procure them Pardons: Or elſe let them cheat and cozen, and they ſhall have Protections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> For your Honour, doubt not of having what countenance Authority of holy Mother Church can give you. And for the increaſe of our Practice, the Maſter of our Revels ſhall give Licenſe for the ſetting up as many Play-houſes as his Holineſs the Pope hath Holidays in his Kalendar, that the Civil Youth of the City may be Debauched and trained up in Looſneſs and Ignorance, whereby the Roman Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion may with eaſe be eſtabliſhed in Court, Church, City, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the moſt effectual means for the accompliſhment of our Deſigns.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> We have taken ſpecial care that our Siſterhood, and the whole Corporation, may be reſtored by Charter to all their former Liberties, Priviledges and Immunities whatſoever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> That Sir—<hi>Berkenhead</hi> and Sir—<hi>Charlton,</hi> two worthy Patriots, together with Sr. <hi>W. M.</hi> lately become zealouſly tender of our Honour, be appointed to bring in a Bill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> next, for a full Toleration of all Bawdy-houſes, Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, Whore-houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that all the Adorers of <hi>Venus</hi> may come to their Worſhip without Moleſtation: And that this <hi>Previſo</hi> may be inſerted, <hi>That all Preaching, Printing, Private Meetings, Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>may be forthwith ſuppreſſed; except thoſe that are Conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at, as Members of Holy Mother Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> We have appointed the Right Reverend Seer of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with other Reverend Seers, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the B. of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> the B. of <hi>Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and Dean <hi>Hardy,</hi> the E. of <hi>Loutherdale,</hi> Mr. <hi>Brounkerd,</hi> and <hi>Bab May,</hi> or any three of them, to be a cloſe <hi>Committee</hi> to conſult the Grievances of the Siſterhood, and to remove all things that may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their happy Reſtauration with all Freedom, Safety, and Honour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> That all Members of <hi>Parliament,</hi> of our Religion, during this Seſſion, and no longer, may uſe their <hi>Priviledge,</hi> in ſending for ſuch of our Siſterhood to their Chambers, as they have a Mind to, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own terms; conſidering they have ſo Freely and Unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Voted Taxes, till their Own Revenues will not maintain them: That the Ingenuity and Gentility of the Siſterhood may appear to all the World, That we are better bred, than to ſlight thoſe that have ſo Nobly provided for us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> We charge that none of the Siſterhood take any more <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingles</hi> or <hi>Caſſocks</hi> to pawn, of any <hi>Churchmen</hi> either Romiſh or Engliſh, when they reel into their Quarters, becauſe they turn not to Accompt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> That if any Alderman will Eat Fleſh in <hi>Lent,</hi> or deal in Prohibited Commodities, Our pleaſure is, That they pay and be paid ſoundly for it, leaſt they build <hi>London</hi>-again; contrary to the intent of thoſe that burnt it: Only let Sir <hi>T.B.</hi> That would Piſs out the Fire, and Lieut.

But above all, We deſire them to be kind to thoſe, who have (to this day, out of their good affection to the <hi>Roman</hi> Intereſt) prevented by ſeveral Artifices, the putting of the aforeſaid Petition into the Hands of Sir <hi>Thomas Allen,</hi> that <hi>Fanatick Zelot,</hi> who was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Court of <hi>Common-Council</hi> to deliver it to the Parliament, who now (to our great Joy) will be Prorogued before they can do any thing in it. Neither let thoſe Worthies be forgotten who (in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite of the Importunities of ſeveral buſie Citizens) have till now hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the preparing of a moſt neceſſary Additional Bill, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building of <hi>London</hi>: Which Work it is hoped will now ceaſe, there being no time before the end of this Seſſion, to carry that Bill through all the Formalities of Parliament.</p>
